# Non-Challenge-Exercises
A project to create sets of coding exercises focussed on building fluency/familiarity of syntax and convention WITHOUT having to solve problems to proceed.


# Intent . 
To create a large number of basic coding exercises to practice fundamental syntax, conventions, styles, and patterns. 


# Form and "style" .
* Each set is a single file, in the language of study.
* A set consisits of a file cotaining comments, almost exclusively.
* A set contains a head comment block that describes **what the user should do**, including what objects or variables they should create, what methods or functions they should use (on the objects or variables), a detailed description and simple example of the pattern the user should use (if a pattern is necesary, or is being exercised), and what kind of results each exercise will be producing/returning/outputting.
* A head comment block may include ENVIRONMENTAL instructions for the user, if helpful. This could say "write and run in any REPL or console"
* Each set has 10 to 20 exercises (12 is ideal for a session of practice, but sets may be used in other ways so more may be useful
* Each exercise has a comment block describing what the user should do, and the result they should get by running the code.

### Contribute please...

You dont have to know how to code to contribute! These are code text files with almost nothing but comments.
